### **1) Sketch the anatomy of an Atom and explain the behaviour of electrons around it**

An atom consists of a central nucleus, which contains protons and neutrons, with electrons orbiting it. In the classical view, an electron's behavior is described by Newton's laws of motion. This would imply that we could precisely calculate its position and momentum at any given time, similar to how we track the motion of a planet. However, this model fails when applied to the subatomic world.

In the quantum world, the behavior of electrons is fundamentally different and is governed by the Schrödinger equation. This equation is the quantum-mechanical equivalent of Newton's second law. Instead of following fixed, predictable orbits, an electron's location is described by a wave function, $\psi(x,t)$, which represents a probability distribution. The square of this wave function's magnitude, $|\psi(x,t)|^2$, gives the probability of finding the electron at a specific position at a given time. This means that while we cannot know the electron's exact path, we can determine the regions where it is most likely to be found. These regions of high probability form what we call atomic orbitals, and their shapes and energies are defined by the electron's quantum numbers.

### **2) What is a wave function and how exactly is it related with the position of any random electron striking the output screen of a double slit experiment.**

A wave function, $\psi(x,t)$, is a mathematical function that completely describes the quantum state of a particle, such as an electron. It is not a physical wave but rather a representation of the particle's state, functioning as a probability amplitude. The probability of finding the particle at a particular position is given by the square of the magnitude of the wave function, $|\psi(x,t)|^2$.

The wave function is central to explaining the double-slit experiment. When a single electron is sent through the slits without being observed, its wave function passes through both slits simultaneously and then interferes with itself. This wave-like behavior results in a characteristic interference pattern on the screen, composed of bright and dark fringes. The electron is most likely to be detected where the interference is constructive (bright fringes) and least likely where it is destructive (dark fringes). Over time, a large number of single electrons build up this full interference pattern.

However, if a detector is placed to determine which slit the electron passes through, the wave function "collapses." The electron is forced to behave as a particle, choosing only one path. This act of observation fundamentally changes the system, and because the electron is no longer in a state of superposition, the interference between paths is eliminated. Consequently, the interference pattern disappears, and only two distinct bands appear on the screen, as if solid particles were being fired.

### **3) With a suitable dataset of your own making, describe the (a) Mean & Median of the data (b) Variance and Standard Deviation of the data. How do these statistical tools help in finding any particular wave function?**

The provided course materials do not contain a detailed explanation of statistical concepts such as mean, median, variance, and standard deviation. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the supplied documents.

### **4) What do you mean by Normalization of a wave function? Why is it done? Explain with a suitable example.**

The provided course materials do not explicitly define the term "normalization" of a wave function. However, they do mention a key concept related to it: for a particle that exists in infinite space, the integral of the square of its wave function over all space must equal one. This is expressed as:
$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|\psi(x,t)|^2 dt = 1$
This equation signifies that there is a 100% probability of finding the particle *somewhere* in the universe. This is a fundamental requirement for any physically meaningful wave function. Normalization is the process of scaling the wave function so that this condition is met. While the materials do not provide a specific example of this process, the principle is that the total probability must always sum to one.

### **5) What are Quantum numbers and how are they obtained?**

Quantum numbers are a set of values that describe the quantum state of an electron in an atom. The notes list four types:
1.  **Principal quantum number ($n$):** This integer number defines the electron's energy level. It can take values $n = 1, 2, 3, ...$.
2.  **Azimuthal quantum number ($l$):** This number defines the shape of the electron's orbital and ranges from $l = 0, 1, ..., n-1$.
3.  **Magnetic quantum number ($m_l$):** This number describes the orientation of the orbital in three-dimensional space and can take integer values from $m_l = -l, ..., 0, ..., +l$.
4.  **Spin quantum number ($s$):** This number describes the intrinsic angular momentum of the electron, or its "spin." It can only have two values: $\pm \frac{1}{2}$.

The first three quantum numbers are obtained as solutions to the time-independent Schrödinger equation. However, the spin quantum number is not a solution to the Schrödinger equation. The Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two electrons in an atom can have the exact same set of four quantum numbers, is mentioned as a reason why electrons must have distinct spins.

### **6) Draw the Coulomb potential and first few energy levels of a hydrogen atom vs the distance and explain how and why it differs from a particle in a (infinite potential) box.**

The provided materials describe two different potential models: the hydrogen atom and the particle in a box.

For a hydrogen atom, the potential is the Coulomb potential, given by $V(x) = \frac{-q^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r}$, where $r$ is the distance from the nucleus. This is an attractive potential, meaning it is negative and becomes less negative as the distance from the nucleus increases. The energy levels for a hydrogen atom are discrete and negative, given by the equation $E_n = \frac{-E_B}{n^2}$, where $E_B$ is the binding energy. These energy levels become closer to zero as $n$ increases.

In contrast, the particle in a box model assumes a simple potential: zero inside the box (from $x=0$ to $x=a$) and infinite outside. This leads to discrete, positive energy levels described by the equation:
$E_n = \frac{n^2\pi^2\hbar^2}{2ma^2}$
As the quantum number $n$ increases, the energy levels become farther apart. The key difference is the nature of the potential. The hydrogen atom's potential is a continuously varying attractive force, while the particle in a box has an abruptly changing, infinite potential wall. This difference in potential results in different energy level characteristics.

### **7) With a suitable diagram describe Bonding, non-bonding and antibonding of atoms for the formation of molecules. What happens to the corresponding wavefunction in each of the three cases?**

When atoms come together to form molecules, their atomic orbitals combine to form new molecular orbitals. The interaction between the wave functions of the individual atoms determines the type of bond.

* **Bonding:** When the atomic orbitals of two atoms overlap constructively (in phase), they form a new molecular orbital with a lower energy level than the original atomic orbitals. This is a stable state. The wave function for a bonding orbital is a linear combination of the individual atomic wave functions, represented as $\psi_{bonding} = \psi_a + \lambda\psi_b$. The probability of finding the electron is highest in the region between the nuclei, which creates an attractive force that holds the molecule together.
* **Antibonding:** When the atomic orbitals overlap destructively (out of phase), they form a molecular orbital with a higher energy level. This is an unstable state. The wave function for an antibonding orbital is represented as $\psi_{antibonding} = \psi_a - \psi_b$. The probability of finding an electron between the nuclei is very low, creating a repulsive force.
* **Non-bonding:** This state occurs when there is no significant interaction between the atoms. The wave functions of the individual atoms remain largely unchanged, and there is no energy gain or loss from forming a bond.

### **8) Explain the band formation in bulk Silicon with necessary diagram(s)**

In an isolated silicon atom, electrons occupy discrete energy levels, such as the 3s and 3p orbitals. When a large number of silicon atoms are brought together to form a bulk crystal, these discrete energy levels merge. The collective interaction of all the atomic orbitals results in the formation of continuous energy bands.

For silicon, the 3s and 3p orbitals merge to form a single, broad energy band. As the interatomic distance decreases, this band splits into two distinct bands separated by an energy gap. These two bands are:
* **Valence Band (VB):** The lower energy band, which is completely filled with electrons at 0 K. These electrons are involved in covalent bonding and do not contribute to electrical conduction.
* **Conduction Band (CB):** The upper energy band, which is empty at 0 K. Electrons in this band are free to move and contribute to electrical current.
* **Bandgap ($E_g$):** The forbidden energy region between the valence and conduction bands. No electron energy states exist in this region. The bandgap for silicon is approximately 1.14 eV.

For an electron to move from the valence band to the conduction band and conduct electricity, it must acquire enough energy to overcome this bandgap.

### **9) From a purely Quantum Mechanical point of view, explain the processes of doping in an intrinsic semiconductor. Can we dope Silicon with divalent or hexavalent dopants? Why or Why not?**

From a quantum mechanical perspective, doping is a process of "bandgap engineering." An intrinsic semiconductor like pure silicon has a specific bandgap. By introducing a small amount of a foreign element (a dopant) into the crystal lattice, we can intentionally create new, discrete energy levels within this bandgap.

* **N-type doping:** This is achieved by doping silicon (Group 14) with a pentavalent element (Group 15), such as phosphorus. The extra valence electron from the dopant atom is loosely bound and creates a new, occupied energy level just below the conduction band. This makes it much easier for electrons to jump into the conduction band, as they only need a small amount of thermal energy.
* **P-type doping:** This is achieved by doping silicon with a trivalent element (Group 13), such as boron. The dopant atom has one less valence electron than silicon, creating a "hole" or an unoccupied energy state just above the valence band. This makes it easier for electrons from the valence band to jump into this new energy level, effectively allowing the holes to move and contribute to conduction.

The choice of dopant elements from Group 13 and Group 15 is crucial because they create energy levels that are very close to the silicon's valence and conduction bands, respectively. The documents suggest that doping with divalent (Group 2) or hexavalent (Group 16) elements is not typically effective. This is because their energy levels would likely be "misaligned" and not fall within the bandgap, providing no advantage in terms of reducing the energy required for conduction.

### **10) What group elements as dopants are required to make N type and P type doping in Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) semiconductor? What polarity of doping takes place when Gallium Arsenide is doped with Silicon atoms?**

Based on the general principles of doping described in the materials, N-type doping requires a dopant from Group 15, while P-type doping requires a dopant from Group 13. However, the documents do not specify which elements are used for doping Gallium Arsenide (GaAs).

Regarding doping GaAs with silicon, the provided materials do not offer an explanation. However, based on the general principles of semiconductor physics, silicon is a Group 14 element. When it is introduced into the GaAs crystal lattice (a III-V compound), it can behave differently depending on which atom it replaces. If a silicon atom substitutes for a gallium atom (Group III), it contributes an extra electron, resulting in N-type doping. If it substitutes for an arsenic atom (Group V), it has one less electron, resulting in P-type doping. Therefore, the resulting polarity of the doped GaAs is not fixed and depends on the specific conditions of the doping process.

### **11) With a suitable diagram describe the process of Optical Lithography**

Optical lithography is a core process in semiconductor manufacturing that uses light to transfer a geometric pattern from a master mask onto a silicon wafer. The process consists of several key steps:

1.  **Wafer Preparation:** A clean silicon wafer is prepared.
2.  **Oxide Growth:** A thin layer of silicon dioxide ($SiO_2$) is grown on the wafer surface.
3.  **Photoresist Application:** A layer of photoresist, a light-sensitive polymer, is applied to the wafer. This is typically done using a spinning process to ensure a uniform layer.
4.  **Mask Alignment:** A photomask, which contains the desired circuit pattern, is aligned over the photoresist-coated wafer. The mask has areas that are opaque and areas that are transparent to light.
5.  **Exposure:** The wafer is exposed to a source of UV light. The light passes through the transparent areas of the mask and exposes the photoresist beneath.
6.  **Development:** A chemical developer solution is used to remove either the exposed or unexposed photoresist. In a **positive photoresist** system, the exposed areas are weakened and dissolved by the developer. In a **negative photoresist** system, the exposed areas polymerize and become stronger, while the unexposed areas are washed away.
7.  **Etching:** The wafer, now with the patterned photoresist acting as a protective layer, is subjected to an etching process. The unprotected oxide layer is removed, transferring the mask pattern to the oxide.
8.  **Doping:** Finally, the wafer can be doped through the openings created in the oxide layer, which now serves as a new mask.

This process is repeated to build complex multi-layered semiconductor devices.
