This means the energy and momentum of the electron diverge.

Physically, this implies an electron cannot be confined in a box of zero width, since it would require infinite energy.### **1) Explain why electrons sent one at a time through a double-slit experiment create an interference pattern on a screen. However, this pattern disappears when we try to determine which slit each electron passes through.**

The double-slit experiment demonstrates the fundamental concept of wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics. When a single electron is sent toward a screen with two slits, it behaves as a wave. Its state is described by a wave function, $\psi$, which represents a probability distribution of its possible locations. This wave function spreads out and passes through both slits simultaneously. The parts of the wave function then interfere with each other, much like ripples in water. This interference creates a pattern of high and low probability on the screen. Over time, as a series of individual electrons hit the screen, their impacts accumulate to form a classic interference pattern, with a higher density of hits in regions of constructive interference and a lower density in regions of destructive interference.

The interference pattern disappears when a detector is used to observe which slit each electron passes through because the act of measurement forces the electron to behave as a particle. When we observe the electron, its wave function instantly "collapses," and it is no longer in a state of superposition. Instead of passing through both slits as a wave, it must choose to pass through only one as a particle. Since there is no longer a wave interfering with itself, the characteristic interference pattern vanishes. The result is two simple bands on the screen, reflecting the two possible paths the particle could have taken.

### **2) What will happen to the position and momentum of an electron, trapped in a two-dimensional (2D) potential box, with infinite length and finite width of "a" when the width "a" is progressively reduced? That is, Limit a $\to$ 0.**

The behavior of an electron confined in a potential box is described by quantum mechanics. For a particle in a one-dimensional box of width $a$, the allowed energy levels are quantized and given by the equation:

$E_n = \frac{n^2 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2 m a^2}$

This formula reveals an inverse relationship between the electron's energy and the square of the box's width, $a^2$. The position of the electron within the box is restricted to a range of $0 \le x \le a$. The momentum of the electron is directly related to its energy, and since the energy levels are quantized, so too are the momentum states.

As the width of the box, $a$, is progressively reduced and approaches zero ($a \to 0$), the denominator of the energy equation approaches zero. Consequently, the energy ($E_n$) of the electron will increase to infinity. Since kinetic energy is the only form of energy for the electron inside this box, an infinite increase in energy implies an infinite increase in momentum. This is a non-physical result, as it would require an infinite amount of energy to confine the electron. From a quantum standpoint, this means that an electron cannot exist in a box of zero width.

The notes begin with the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle with potential $V(x)$:
$E\psi(x)=-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\frac{d^{2}\psi(x)}{dx^{2}}+V\psi(x)$

For the case of a particle in an infinite potential well, the potential is defined as $V(x)=0$ for $0 \le x \le a$ and $V(x)=\infty$ otherwise. Inside the well, where $V(x)=0$, the equation simplifies to:
$E\psi(x)=-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\frac{d^{2}\psi(x)}{dx^{2}}$

The solution to this equation is a wave function $\psi(x) = A\sin(kx) + B\cos(kx)$, where $k$ is related to the energy by $E=\frac{k^2\hbar^2}{2m}$.

Using boundary conditions, $\psi(0) = 0$ and $\psi(a) = 0$, the notes show that the cosine term drops out ($B=0$) and the sine term must satisfy $A\sin(ka) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($A \neq 0$), this requires $ka = n\pi$, where $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$

Substituting $k = \frac{n\pi}{a}$ back into the energy equation gives the quantized energy levels for the particle:
$E_n = \frac{n^2\pi^2\hbar^2}{2ma^2}$

This equation directly answers the core of your question. As the width "a" of the box is progressively reduced and approaches zero ($a \to 0$), the energy ($E_n$) of the electron increases towards infinity. Since the electron's momentum is directly related to its energy, its momentum will also increase infinitely. The notes do not explicitly discuss the 2D case, but the principle is the same: the confinement of the particle in any dimension leads to quantized energy levels, and shrinking the dimension to zero forces the energy and momentum to become infinite.

### **Solution:**

The behavior of an electron confined in a potential box is described by quantum mechanics.

For a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of width \$a\$, the allowed energy levels are quantized as:

$$
E_n = \frac{n^2 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2 m a^2}, \quad n = 1,2,3,\dots
$$

---

### **Derivation:**

The time-independent Schrödinger equation is:

$$
E\psi(x) = -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\frac{d^{2}\psi(x)}{dx^{2}} + V(x)\psi(x)
$$

For an infinite potential well:

$$
V(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
0, & 0 \leq x \leq a \\
\infty, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

Inside the well (\$V(x)=0\$):

$$
E\psi(x) = -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\frac{d^{2}\psi(x)}{dx^{2}}
$$

General solution:

$$
\psi(x) = A\sin(kx) + B\cos(kx), \quad E=\frac{k^2\hbar^2}{2m}
$$

Boundary conditions:

* \$\psi(0) = 0 \implies B=0\$
* \$\psi(a) = 0 \implies k a = n\pi\$

Thus:

$$
k = \frac{n\pi}{a}, \quad \psi_n(x) = A\sin\!\left(\frac{n\pi x}{a}\right)
$$

Substituting \$k\$ back:

$$
E_n = \frac{n^2 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2 m a^2}
$$

---

### **Physical Interpretation:**

* The position of the electron is restricted to \$0 \leq x \leq a\$.
* The momentum is related to the energy:

  $$
  p_n = \hbar k = \frac{n\pi\hbar}{a}
  $$

---

### **Limit \$a \to 0\$:**

* As \$a \to 0\$,

  $$
  E_n \to \infty \quad \text{and} \quad p_n \to \infty
  $$

* This means **the energy and momentum of the electron diverge**.

* Physically, this implies an **electron cannot be confined in a box of zero width**, since it would require infinite energy.

---

### **Extension to 2D Case:**

In 2D, the energy levels are:

$$
E_{n_x,n_y} = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2m}\left( \frac{n_x^2}{a^2} + \frac{n_y^2}{L^2} \right)
$$

where \$L \to \infty\$ (infinite length).
Thus, confinement only along \$x\$ matters, and as \$a \to 0\$, the same divergence occurs.

---

### **Final Answer (for 10 marks):**

As the width \$a\$ is reduced to zero, the electron’s **energy and momentum both diverge to infinity**, making it physically impossible to confine an electron in such a box.

### **3) (a) Why do atoms form bonds amongst themselves to create molecules? (b) Describe what happens to wavefunctions of individual atoms once they bond to form molecules.**

**(a)** Atoms form bonds with each other to create molecules because it allows them to reach a more stable, lower-energy state. When two atoms are brought close together, there is a complex interplay of forces. Attractive forces exist between the nucleus of one atom and the electrons of the other, while repulsive forces exist between the two nuclei and between the two electron clouds. A stable chemical bond forms only when the attractive forces dominate, resulting in a net reduction in the overall energy of the system. This energy reduction is the primary driving force behind the formation of molecules.

**(b)** When atoms bond, their individual electron wavefunctions combine and overlap to form new, shared molecular wavefunctions. This process can be described in two primary ways:

* **Constructive Interference (Bonding):** If the individual atomic wavefunctions overlap "in-phase," they interfere constructively. This creates a new, lower-energy molecular orbital called a bonding orbital. In a bonding orbital, the probability of finding the electrons is highest in the region between the two atomic nuclei, which strengthens the bond. The wavefunction for a bonding orbital can be represented as a linear combination of the atomic wavefunctions, such as $\psi_{AB} = c_1 \psi_A + c_2 \psi_B$.

* **Destructive Interference (Antibonding):** If the atomic wavefunctions overlap "out-of-phase," they interfere destructively. This forms a higher-energy molecular orbital known as an antibonding orbital. In this state, the probability of finding the electrons between the nuclei is very low, creating a repulsive force that weakens the bond. The wavefunction for an antibonding orbital can be represented as $\psi_{AB} = c_1 \psi_A - c_2 \psi_B$.

### **4) Explain Figure 1, especially the encircled part. Assume Silicon Lattice with all usual notations.**

Figure 1 illustrates the formation of energy bands in a bulk semiconductor material, specifically a silicon crystal. The vertical axis represents energy, while the horizontal axis represents the interatomic distance.

At large interatomic distances (far right of the graph), the atoms are isolated, and their electrons occupy discrete, well-defined energy levels, such as the 3s and 3p orbitals for silicon.

As the interatomic distance is reduced and the atoms get closer, their electron wavefunctions begin to overlap. This interaction causes the discrete energy levels to broaden and merge into continuous energy bands. The encircled region on the graph highlights the point where the 3s and 3p orbitals have merged to form a single, broad energy band.

Beyond this point, as the atoms are brought even closer to the stable crystalline distance ($a$), this single band splits into two distinct energy bands separated by a forbidden region:

* **Valence Band:** This is the lower-energy band, derived from the bonding interactions. At absolute zero temperature, this band is completely filled with electrons.
* **Conduction Band:** This is the upper-energy band, formed from the antibonding interactions. At absolute zero, this band is empty.

The energy gap between these two bands is called the bandgap ($E_g$). The region to the left of the encircled part represents the stable silicon crystal structure with its well-defined valence and conduction bands.

### **5) (a) What will be the effect of doping Intrinsic Silicon with dopant elements from Group 1 and Group 7? (b) What will be the polarity of a GaAs semiconductor crystal doped with Silicon dopants? Explain your answer.**

**(a)** The process of doping in semiconductors is a form of "bandgap engineering" used to control their electrical properties. Doping is typically performed with elements from Group 13 (trivalent) or Group 15 (pentavalent) because their energy levels are very close to the silicon's valence and conduction bands, respectively, and are created within the bandgap. This allows for a significant increase in charge carriers with minimal thermal energy.

Doping silicon with elements from Group 1 or Group 7 would likely be ineffective. A Group 1 element (e.g., sodium) has only one valence electron, while a Group 7 element (e.g., fluorine) has seven. Neither of these valence numbers is suitable for forming the required energy levels close to the conduction or valence bands of silicon (a Group 14 element). The resulting energy levels would be "misaligned" and would not provide any significant advantage in terms of enhancing conductivity.

**(b)** Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) is a III-V compound semiconductor, composed of Group 13 (Gallium) and Group 15 (Arsenic) elements. Silicon (Si) is a Group 14 element. When a GaAs crystal is doped with silicon, the silicon atom can substitute either a gallium or an arsenic atom, which leads to different doping polarities:

* If a silicon atom substitutes for a gallium atom (Group 13), the silicon atom has one extra valence electron that is not needed for bonding. This extra electron can be easily donated to the conduction band, making the material **N-type**.
* If a silicon atom substitutes for an arsenic atom (Group 15), the silicon atom has one less electron than needed to complete its bonds. This creates a "hole," which can accept an electron from the valence band, making the material **P-type**.

The resulting polarity of the doped GaAs depends on which site the silicon atom occupies.

### **6) With proper diagrams, explain how does the electron transits from Valence band to Conduction Band and returns back to Valence Band, in Direct vs. Indirect Semiconductors.**

In semiconductors, an electron's transition between the valence band (VB) and the conduction band (CB) is governed by both energy and momentum. The momentum is represented by the wave vector, $k$.

* **Direct Bandgap Semiconductors (e.g., GaAs):** In these materials, the minimum energy of the conduction band and the maximum energy of the valence band occur at the same momentum ($k$) value. For an electron to transition from the VB to the CB, it only needs to absorb a photon with energy greater than or equal to the bandgap energy ($E_g$). The electron's momentum does not need to change. This is a highly efficient process. When the electron returns to the valence band, it releases a photon, conserving energy without the need for an additional particle.

* **Indirect Bandgap Semiconductors (e.g., Silicon):** In these materials, the minimum of the conduction band and the maximum of the valence band are at different momentum values. Therefore, for an electron to transition from the VB to the CB, it must change both its energy and its momentum. This process requires a third particle, a phonon (a quantum of lattice vibration), to be involved. The electron absorbs both a photon (for energy) and a phonon (for momentum) to complete the transition. The reverse process also requires the emission of both a photon and a phonon to conserve both energy and momentum.

### **7) Why the Fermi level aligns and no gradient in it is possible, when an n-type and p-type semiconductors are brought in contact with one another?**

The provided course materials do not contain information about the Fermi level aligning or about the absence of a gradient when n-type and p-type semiconductors are brought into contact. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the supplied documents.
