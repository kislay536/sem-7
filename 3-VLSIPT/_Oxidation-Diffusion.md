### VLSI Process Technology: Oxidation and Diffusion

These are detailed lecture notes on the VLSI processes of oxidation and diffusion. I will go through each slide, explaining the concepts, diagrams, and text in detail without skipping anything.

**Page 1: Title Slide**
* [cite_start]**VLSI Process Technology 2025 [cite: 1]**
* [cite_start]**Oxidation [cite: 2]**

This is the title page, introducing the course "VLSI Process Technology" and the topic of the lecture, "Oxidation".

**Page 2: Introduction to Oxidation**
* [cite_start]**Oxidation: Process of formation of $SiO_2/SiO_x$ from Silicon [cite: 5]**
    * This is the fundamental definition of oxidation in the context of VLSI. It's the process where silicon (Si) is converted into silicon dioxide ($SiO_2$) or a sub-stoichiometric silicon oxide ($SiO_x$).
* [cite_start]**One of the most important characteristics of Si: Ability to form $SiO_2$ very easily [cite: 6]**
    * This highlights a key reason why silicon is the dominant material in the semiconductor industry. The ease of forming a high-quality, stable oxide layer is crucial for device fabrication.
* [cite_start]**Type of Oxides [cite: 7]**
    * [cite_start]**Native Oxides: Oxide grown when Silicon is exposed to the ambient [cite: 8]**
        * This refers to the thin, naturally forming oxide layer that appears on silicon when it is exposed to air at room temperature.
    * [cite_start]**Grown Oxides: Underlying Silicon is consumed during oxidation [cite: 9]**
        * This is the focus of the lecture's oxidation section, specifically thermal oxidation. The Si substrate is consumed to form the $SiO_2$ layer.
    * **Deposited Oxides: Oxides deposited on Si using physical deposition methods. [cite_start]Underlying Silicon is not consumed [cite: 10]**
        * These are oxides that are laid on top of the silicon wafer, rather than grown from it. The silicon substrate remains untouched.
* [cite_start]**Uses of $SiO_2$ [cite: 11]**
    * [cite_start]**As masking element [cite: 12]**: $SiO_2$ is used to block dopant diffusion or ion implantation in specific areas.
    * [cite_start]**As surface passivation (to protect the surface from external hazards) [cite: 13]**: It provides a stable, protective layer for the underlying silicon.
    * [cite_start]**As gate oxide in MOS devices [cite: 14]**: This is a critical application, forming the insulating layer between the gate and the channel in a MOSFET.
    * [cite_start]**As isolation between two devices (Shallow/deep trench isolation) [cite: 15]**: $SiO_2$ is used to electrically isolate different components on a chip, preventing unwanted current leakage.
    * [cite_start]**As field oxide [cite: 15]**: This is a specific type of isolation used to separate active device areas.

**Page 3: Thermal Oxidation of Silicon**
* [cite_start]**7.1 THERMAL OXIDATION OF SILICON [cite: 16]**
* [cite_start]**The surface of silicon is covered at all times with a layer of $SiO_2$. [cite: 17]**
    * This reiterates the concept of native oxide.
* [cite_start]**This is even true for freshly cleaved silicon, which becomes covered with a few monolayers ($=15-20 \dot{A}$) of oxide upon exposure to air, gradually thickening with time to an upper limit of about 40 Ã…. [cite: 18]**
    * This provides specific details about native oxide formation, including its initial rapid growth and self-limiting thickness.
* [cite_start]**Films of this type are patchy in character and are of no technological value. [cite: 19]**
    * This explains why native oxides are not suitable for high-quality device fabrication. Their non-uniform, low-quality nature makes them unreliable.
* [cite_start]**Considerably thicker films are required in silicon microcircuit fabrication. [cite: 20]**
    * This justifies the need for controlled, intentional oxidation processes like thermal oxidation.
* [cite_start]**Here, an oxide film is grown on the slice by maintaining it in an elevated temperature in an oxidizing ambient, usually dry oxygen or water vapor. [cite: 21]**
    * This defines thermal oxidation, specifying the key parameters: high temperature and an oxidizing atmosphere ($O_2$ or $H_2O$).
* [cite_start]**An important property of thermally grown $SiO_2$ is its ability to reduce the surface state density of silicon by tying up some of its dangling bonds. [cite: 22]**
    * This is a crucial benefit of thermal oxidation. It passivates the silicon surface, reducing defects that can lead to poor electrical performance.
* [cite_start]**Moreover, silicon oxides can be grown with good control over interface traps and fixed charge. [cite: 23]**
    * This highlights the high quality and control offered by thermal oxidation, which is essential for consistent device characteristics.
* [cite_start]**Their use in controlling the leakage current of junction devices [1], and in the formation of a stable gate oxide for field effect devices, stems from these properties and makes them the cornerstone of modern silicon integrated circuit technology. [cite: 24]**
    * This summarizes the importance of thermal oxidation, connecting its high-quality properties to its widespread use in modern ICs, particularly for junction and gate oxides.

**Page 4: Why Silicon Dominates IC Industry**
* This page presents a list of reasons for silicon's dominance, accompanied by a diagram showing a section of the periodic table.
* [cite_start]**Why silicon still dominates the IC industry? [cite: 25]**
    * The points listed are:
        * [cite_start]Abundance [cite: 26]
        * [cite_start]High melting point [cite: 27]
        * [cite_start]Crystalline structure [cite: 28]
        * [cite_start]Reliable performance [cite: 29]
        * [cite_start]Established infrastructure [cite: 30]
        * [cite_start]Compatibility [cite: 31]
        * [cite_start]Versatility [cite: 32]
        * [cite_start]Research and development [cite: 33]
        * [cite_start]Cost-effectiveness [cite: 34]
        * [cite_start]Industry standard [cite: 35]
* The diagram shows the periodic table, with Silicon (Si) highlighted in the IVA group. The arrows from group IIIA (Aluminum, Gallium, Indium) and VA (Phosphorus, Arsenic, Antimony) looping back to Silicon illustrate that these elements are commonly used as dopants for Si.
* [cite_start]**90% IC revenue is from Mos FET [cite: 99]**
    * This statement emphasizes the commercial importance of MOS technology, which relies heavily on high-quality $SiO_2$ as a gate dielectric.

**Page 5: Silicon vs. Other Semiconductors**
* This slide features a humorous meme, comparing Silicon's ability to form $SiO_2$ to a dialogue from a popular movie.
* [cite_start]**Silicon vs Other Semiconductors [cite: 100]**
    * The dialogue "AAJ Mere Paas High Bandgap Hai, High Mobility Hai, High Breakdown bhi Hai; KYA HAI TUMHARE PAAS??" ("Today I have a high bandgap, high mobility, high breakdown; what do you have??") [cite_start]represents other semiconductor materials like Gallium Nitride (GaN) or Silicon Carbide (SiC) that have superior intrinsic electrical properties. [cite: 101, 102, 103]
    * [cite_start]The reply from Silicon, "MERE PAAS $SiO_2$ Hai" ("I have $SiO_2$"), is the punchline. [cite: 104]
    * This meme cleverly conveys that despite the superior inherent electrical properties of some newer materials, silicon's unique ability to form a high-quality, stable native oxide ($SiO_2$) is its killer feature, making it indispensable for mass production of devices like MOSFETs. The oxide's properties, such as being an excellent insulator and passivating the surface, are the key to its dominance.

**Page 6: Processes of Oxidation**
* [cite_start]**Processes of Oxidation [cite: 105]**
* [cite_start]**Chemical Oxidation [cite: 106]**:
    * [cite_start]**$SiO_2$ obtained by boiling Silicon in $HNO_3$ [cite: 107]**. This is a wet chemical method.
* [cite_start]**Anodic Oxidation [cite: 108]**:
    * [cite_start]**Silicon as anode, noble metal as cathode [cite: 109]**. This process uses an electrochemical setup.
    * [cite_start]**Placed in an electrolyte [cite: 110]**. The silicon and cathode are immersed in an electrolyte solution.
    * [cite_start]**Silicon moves out and oxidizes [cite: 111]**. The Si atoms are ionized and move from the anode to react with oxygen in the electrolyte, forming oxide on the surface.
* [cite_start]**Thermal oxidation [cite: 112]**:
    * [cite_start]**Heating up silicon in presence of $O_2$ or steam [cite: 113]**. This is the most common method in VLSI and the focus of the lecture.
    * [cite_start]**Quality is the best and most widely used [cite: 114]**. This emphasizes the superiority of thermal oxidation for manufacturing high-performance devices.
* [cite_start]The diagram illustrates the anodic oxidation process, showing the setup with a power supply, anode (silicon), cathode, and electrolyte, with the formation of an oxide layer and gas bubbles. [cite: 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123]

**Page 7: Thermal Oxidation vs. Anodic Oxidation**
* This page provides a direct comparison of the two key oxidation methods.
* [cite_start]**Thermal Oxidation [cite: 125]**
    * [cite_start]**High temperature process ($900-1200^{\circ}C$) [cite: 126]**.
    * [cite_start]**Quality of oxide is much better [cite: 127]**.
    * [cite_start]**Less prone to contamination: oxidizing species moves inside [cite: 128]**. Since the reaction happens at the buried Si-$SiO_2$ interface, the newly formed oxide layer is shielded from external contaminants.
    * [cite_start]**Changes doping profile [cite: 129]**. The high temperature causes dopants to diffuse, altering their concentration profile.
    * [cite_start]**Thermal oxidation can not be used as a diagnostic tool [cite: 130, 131]**. The process isn't easily monitored for real-time thickness measurement.
* [cite_start]**Anodic Oxidation [cite: 132]**
    * [cite_start]**Room temperature process [cite: 133]**.
    * [cite_start]**Quality of oxide is poor [cite: 134]**.
    * [cite_start]**More prone to contamination: interface moves outside [cite: 135]**. Since the Si atoms move to the surface to react, the interface is exposed to the ambient.
    * [cite_start]**Doping profile remains unaffected (room temperature process) [cite: 136]**.
    * **Anodic oxidation can be used as a diagnostic tool. [cite_start]As the oxide thickness grows, the voltage across the two electrodes builds up and this can be accurately linked to the oxide thickness. [cite: 137]**.
    * [cite_start]**It follows $3A/V$ rule i.e., 10 volts developed across the electrodes means 30 Ã… of oxide has been grown. [cite: 138]**. This explains the diagnostic capability of anodic oxidation.

**Page 8: Mechanism of Thermal Oxidation**
* This slide clarifies the correct mechanism of thermal oxidation.
* [cite_start]**Movement of oxidizing species into silicon causes oxidation [cite: 139]**. This is the key takeaway.
* The two diagrams show two possibilities:
    * **Left Diagram**: Shows Silicon moving outwards to react with an oxidizing species at the surface. [cite_start]This is incorrect, as indicated by the 'X'. [cite: 142]
    * **Right Diagram**: Shows the oxidizing species (like $O_2$) moving inwards, through the existing oxide layer, to react with the underlying silicon. [cite_start]This is the correct mechanism for thermal oxidation, as indicated by the 'âœ“'. [cite: 145]
* [cite_start]**There are two possibilities during oxidation. [cite: 148]**
* [cite_start]**Silicon can move out and react on the outer surface... [cite: 149, 150, 151, 152]**. This is described as a hypothetical, incorrect mechanism.
* [cite_start]**The other possibility: oxidizing species move in and reacts with silicon to form oxide [cite: 153]**. This is the correct, physically observed mechanism.
* [cite_start]**Kinetics of oxidation: How the species are being transported [cite: 154]**. This introduces the concept of oxidation kinetics, which describes the rate and mechanism of the process.
* The bottom diagram breaks down the process:
    1.  [cite_start]$O_2$ (or $H_2O$) diffuses through the existing $SiO_2$ layer. [cite: 157, 158]
    2.  [cite_start]The reaction happens at the $SiO_2$-Si interface. [cite: 155]
    3.  [cite_start]The new $SiO_2$ layer is formed by consuming the silicon substrate. [cite: 160]

**Page 9: Types of Thermal Oxidation and Volume Expansion**
* [cite_start]**Types of thermal oxidation [cite: 164]**
    * [cite_start]**Dry Oxidation: Oxidation in presence of dry oxygen [cite: 165][cite_start]**: The reaction is $Si + O_2 \rightarrow SiO_2$[cite: 166].
    * [cite_start]**Wet Oxidation: Oxidation in presence of water Vapour [cite: 167][cite_start]**: The reaction is $Si + 2H_2O \rightarrow SiO_2 + 2H_2$[cite: 167].
* [cite_start]**Both of these processes are carried out at a temperature of around $900-1200^{\circ}C$ [cite: 168]**. This gives the typical temperature range.
* [cite_start]**Oxidizing species moves inside and reacts with the underlying Silicon [cite: 169]**. This reinforces the mechanism.
* [cite_start]**Overall thickness of $SiO_2$/Si is higher than the silicon substrate [cite: 170]**. This is due to volume expansion.
* [cite_start]**Consumption of underlying silicon during thermal oxidation [cite: 171]**
    * The diagram illustrates the volume expansion. [cite_start]The thickness of the consumed silicon ($t_{si}$) is 0.46 times the thickness of the grown oxide ($t_{ox}$). [cite: 172, 187, 194]
    * The total thickness of the oxidized structure (oxide + remaining silicon) is larger than the initial silicon thickness. [cite_start]The new oxide surface is higher than the original silicon surface. [cite: 176, 191, 192]
    * [cite_start]**Volume expansion = 2.17 times [cite: 174]**. This is the key ratio. For every 1 unit of silicon volume consumed, 2.17 units of $SiO_2$ volume are formed.
* [cite_start]The diagram shows a typical thermal oxidation furnace with a quartz tube, resistance heating, and gas inlets for $N_2/Ar$, $O_2$, and $H_2O$. [cite: 175, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 188, 189]
* [cite_start]**To grow $2.17 \mu m$ of $SiO_2$ [cite: 196]**:
    * [cite_start]**Underlying Silicon consumed = $1 \mu m$ [cite: 197]**. This is a direct application of the 2.17 volume expansion ratio.

**Page 10: Derivation of Volume Expansion Ratio**
* This page shows the calculation for the volume expansion ratio.
* [cite_start]**For $Si + O_2 \rightarrow SiO_2$ [cite: 204]**:
    * [cite_start]Atomic weight of Si is 28 g/mol. [cite: 205]
    * [cite_start]Molecular weight of $O_2$ is 32 g/mol. [cite: 206]
    * [cite_start]Molecular weight of $SiO_2$ is 60 g/mol. [cite: 209]
* **Mass of $SiO_2$ formed = Mass of Si consumed**.
    * [cite_start]$Mass_{SiO_2} = \rho_{SiO_2} \times Volume_{SiO_2} = \rho_{SiO_2} \times A \times t_{ox}$ [cite: 210]
    * [cite_start]$Mass_{Si} = \rho_{Si} \times Volume_{Si} = \rho_{Si} \times A \times t_{si}$ [cite: 212]
* Equating the masses: $60 g = \rho_{SiO_2} \times A \times t_{ox}$ and $28 g = \rho_{Si} \times A \times t_{si}$.
* Solving for $t_{ox}$ and $t_{si}$:
    * [cite_start]$t_{ox} = \frac{60}{A \times \rho_{SiO_2}} = \frac{60}{A \times 2.27}$ [cite: 211]
    * [cite_start]$t_{si} = \frac{28}{A \times \rho_{Si}} = \frac{28}{A \times 2.32}$ [cite: 214]
    * [cite_start]$\rho_{SiO_2} = 2.27 g/cm^3$ and $\rho_{Si} = 2.32 g/cm^3$. [cite: 211, 214]
* [cite_start]**Taking the ratio $\frac{t_{si}}{t_{ox}}$ [cite: 216]**:
    * [cite_start]$\frac{t_{si}}{t_{ox}} = \frac{28}{A \times 2.32} \times \frac{A \times 2.27}{60} \approx 0.46$ [cite: 219]
    * This derivation confirms that the thickness of consumed silicon is approximately 46% of the final oxide thickness.

**Page 11: Oxidation Furnace and Wafer Handling**
* This page shows a diagram and a photograph of an oxidation furnace.
* [cite_start]The diagram shows the setup: a quartz tube, a resistance-heated furnace, gas flowmeters for different ambients ($HCl$, $N_2$, $O_2$, $H_2$), a quartz boat holding the silicon wafers, and an exhaust. [cite: 227, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233]
* The photograph shows a cleanroom environment with a person in a clean suit next to a large piece of equipment, which is an oxidation furnace. [cite_start]The text mentions that wafers are loaded/unloaded very slowly to prevent thermal shock. [cite: 234, 235]

**Page 12: Advantages and Properties of Thermal Oxide**
* [cite_start]**Advantage of thermal oxidation [cite: 236]**
    * [cite_start]**Silicon surface is free from contamination [cite: 237]**.
    * [cite_start]**Oxidizing species moves inside the substrate and reacts with silicon [cite: 238]**. This is the reason for the lack of contamination at the interface.
    * [cite_start]**Silicon surface is not exposed to the ambient [cite: 239]**.
    * [cite_start]**Interface is protected from the contaminants [cite: 240]**.
    * [cite_start]**Quality of thermal oxide is the best [cite: 241]**.
* [cite_start]**Properties of thermal oxide [cite: 242]**
    * [cite_start]**Amorphous [cite: 243]**: The atomic structure is disordered, which is beneficial for a good electrical insulator.
    * [cite_start]**Stable, reproducible, conformal $SiO_2$ growth [cite: 244]**: The process is reliable and creates a uniform layer that follows the contours of the silicon surface.
    * [cite_start]**High melting point ($1700^{\circ}C$) [cite: 245]**: It is stable under high-temperature processing steps.
    * [cite_start]**High density [cite: 246]**.
    * [cite_start]**Excellent insulator [cite: 247]**.
    * [cite_start]**High bandgap (8-9 eV) and critical electric field ($\sim 10 MV/cm$) [cite: 248]**. These are key electrical properties that make it an effective gate dielectric.

**Page 13: Deal-Grove Model**
* [cite_start]**Kinetics of Oxide growth: Deal Grove Model [cite: 249]**
    * [cite_start]**Kinetics of Oxidation: Refers to the process of how the oxidizing species are being transported [cite: 250]**. The model provides a mathematical framework to understand and predict the oxidation process.
    * [cite_start]**Predicted by Deal and Grove in the year 1965 [cite: 250]**. This provides historical context.
* [cite_start]**The model is valid for: [cite: 252]**
    * [cite_start]Temperature: $700-1300^{\circ}C$ [cite: 253]
    * [cite_start]Pressure: $0.1-1$ atm [cite: 254]
    * [cite_start]Ambient: $O_2$ or $H_2O$ [cite: 255]
* [cite_start]A citation to the original 1965 paper is included, summarizing its key findings, including the general relationship $x_0^2 + Ax_0 = B(t + \tau)$. [cite: 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266]

**Page 14: Deal-Grove Model: Fluxes and Assumptions**
* This page introduces the three fluxes that make up the Deal-Grove model.
* [cite_start]**Flux: No. of molecules or atoms crossing a unit area per unit time [cite: 267]**. This is the definition of flux.
* **$F_1$: Gas transport flux. [cite_start]Flux with which oxidizing species are transported from bulk of the gas phase to the gas-oxide interface [cite: 268]**. This is the first step: getting the oxidant to the surface.
    * [cite_start]It is described by the equation $F_1 = h_G(C_G - C_S)$[cite: 281].
* **$F_2$: Diffusion Flux. [cite_start]Flux with which oxidizing species are transported across existing oxide towards silicon [cite: 269]**. This is the second step: diffusion through the oxide.
    * [cite_start]It is described by Fick's Law: $F_2 = D \frac{dC}{dx}$[cite: 282].
* **$F_3$: Reaction Flux. [cite_start]Flux with which the oxidizing species react with Silicon at the $SiO_2$-Si interface. [cite: 270]**. This is the third and final step: the chemical reaction.
    * [cite_start]It is described by a first-order reaction: $F_3 = K_S C_i$[cite: 286].
* [cite_start]The diagram visually represents these three steps and the corresponding concentrations ($C_G$, $C_S$, $C_o$, $C_i$, $C^*$). [cite: 274, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286]
* [cite_start]A table summarizes the key assumptions of the model, including the three-stage mechanism, the use of Henry's and Fick's laws, the steady-state flux assumption ($F_1=F_2=F_3$), and the one-dimensional and fast gas-phase transport assumptions. [cite: 273]
* The concentrations are defined:
    * [cite_start]$C_G$: Conc. of oxidizing species in bulk of gas [cite: 271]
    * [cite_start]$C_S$: Conc. of oxidizing species right next to gas-oxide interface [cite: 272]
    * [cite_start]$C_o$: Conc. of oxidizing species in outer oxide surface [cite: 287]
    * [cite_start]$C_i$: Conc. of oxidizing species in inner oxide surface [cite: 288]
    * $C^*$: Equilibrium conc. of oxidizing species in oxide. [cite_start]This is also the solubility limit in the oxide. [cite: 288, 289]

**Page 15: Deal-Grove Model: Flux Equations**
* [cite_start]**Overall Process: [cite: 290]**
    * **Process no. [cite_start]1: Transfer of the oxidizing species from gas stream to the gas-oxide interface [cite: 292]**. This is governed by the mass transfer coefficient, $h_G$.
    * **Process no. [cite_start]2: Diffusion of the oxidizing species through the existing oxide to react with silicon at the $SiO_2$-Si interface [cite: 293]**. Governed by the diffusion coefficient, D.
    * **Process no. [cite_start]3: Reaction of oxidizing species with silicon [cite: 294]**. Governed by the reaction rate constant, $k_S$.
* [cite_start]**Flux $F_1$: [cite: 295]**
    * [cite_start]The equation $F_1 = h_G(C_G - C_S)$ is presented. [cite: 296]
    * [cite_start]Henry's law, which states that the concentration of a gas dissolved in a solid is proportional to its partial pressure at the surface ($C_o = HP_S$), is introduced. [cite: 298, 299, 305]
    * [cite_start]The flux equation is then re-expressed in terms of concentration in the oxide, $C^*$, as $F_1 = h(C^* - C_o)$. [cite: 306]

**Page 16: Deal-Grove Model: Flux F2 and F3**
* [cite_start]**Flux F2: [cite: 307]**
    * [cite_start]**Flux F2 is related to the movement (diffusion) of the oxidizing species through the existing oxide layer due to concentration gradient [cite: 308]**.
    * [cite_start]**The diffusion Follows Fick's Law [cite: 309]**.
    * [cite_start]**Flux F2 can be represented as, $F_2 = D(\frac{C_o - C_i}{x})$ [cite: 311]**. Here, $x$ is the oxide thickness.
* [cite_start]**Flux F3: [cite: 314]**
    * [cite_start]**Flux F3 is related to the reaction of silicon with the oxidizing species [cite: 315]**.
    * [cite_start]**The reaction will be governed by the availability of the oxidizing species [cite: 316]**.
    * [cite_start]**Flux F3 is proportional to the concentration of the oxidizing species at the oxide-silicon interface [cite: 318]**.
    * [cite_start]**Flux F3 can be represented as, $F_3 = k_S C_i$ [cite: 320]**.

**Page 17: Deal-Grove Model: Deriving the Total Flux**
* This page shows the derivation of the total flux equation by assuming a steady state where $F_1 = F_2 = F_3$.
* [cite_start]By equating the fluxes, expressions for $C_i$ and $C_o$ are found in terms of the equilibrium concentration $C^*$ and the rate constants. [cite: 322, 323, 325, 326, 328, 330]
* The final expression for the total flux, $F$, is presented:
    * [cite_start]$F = \frac{k_S C^*}{1 + \frac{k_S}{h} + \frac{k_S x}{D}}$ [cite: 331]
    * This equation shows how the overall oxidation rate is dependent on all three process steps.

**Page 18: Deal-Grove Model: Limiting Cases**
* This page discusses the two limiting cases of the Deal-Grove model.
* [cite_start]The general flux equation is presented again. [cite: 335]
* [cite_start]**When D is very large ($D \rightarrow \infty$): Reaction Controlled Case [cite: 337]**
    * This happens for very thin oxide layers, where the time for the oxidant to diffuse through the oxide is negligible compared to the reaction time.
    * The flux becomes independent of oxide thickness: $F \approx \frac{k_S C^*}{1 + \frac{k_S}{h}}$.
    * [cite_start]The concentration profile in the oxide is flat, with $C_i \rightarrow C_o$. [cite: 337, 347, 348, 355]
* [cite_start]**When D is very small ($D \rightarrow 0$): Diffusion Controlled Case [cite: 336]**
    * This happens for thick oxide layers, where the rate-limiting step is the diffusion of the oxidant through the oxide.
    * The flux becomes inversely proportional to the oxide thickness: $F \approx \frac{D C^*}{x}$.
    * [cite_start]The concentration profile in the oxide is linear, with a steep drop, and $C_i \rightarrow 0$. [cite: 336, 348, 350, 356]
* [cite_start]The diagrams illustrate these two cases. [cite: 342, 343, 344, 345, 346, 347, 348, 352, 353, 354]

**Page 19: Deal-Grove Model: Oxide Growth Rate Equation**
* [cite_start]**Oxide Growth Rate: [cite: 357]**
* The relationship between the flux and the rate of oxide growth is given:
    * [cite_start]$F = N_1 \frac{dX_{ox}}{dt}$ [cite: 360]
    * [cite_start]$N_1$ is the number of oxidant molecules incorporated per unit volume of the oxide. [cite: 363]
    * [cite_start]$\frac{dX_{ox}}{dt}$ is the rate of change of oxide thickness. [cite: 362]
* By substituting the flux equation from page 17, the differential equation for oxide growth is obtained:
    * [cite_start]$N_1 \frac{dX_{ox}}{dt} = \frac{k_S C^*}{1 + \frac{k_S}{h} + \frac{k_S x_{ox}}{D}}$ [cite: 367]
* This equation is integrated to yield the famous Deal-Grove equation:
    * [cite_start]$X_{ox}^2 + AX_{ox} = B(t + \tau)$ [cite: 377]
    * The constants are defined:
        * [cite_start]$A = \frac{2D}{k_S}(1 + \frac{k_S}{h})$ [cite: 369]
        * [cite_start]$B = \frac{2DC^*}{N_1}$ [cite: 372]
        * [cite_start]$\tau = \frac{A x_i + x_i^2}{B}$ (for initial oxide thickness $x_i$) [cite: 377]
* [cite_start]The final solution for oxide thickness $X_{ox}$ is also shown. [cite: 377]

**Page 20: Deal-Grove Model: Linear and Parabolic Regimes**
* This page discusses the two regimes of oxide growth based on the Deal-Grove equation.
* [cite_start]The full solution for $X_{ox}$ is presented again. [cite: 380]
* [cite_start]**Case I: When t is very small [cite: 381]**
    * The quadratic term is negligible, so the growth is linear with time.
    * [cite_start]$X_{ox} \approx \frac{B}{A}(t + \tau)$ [cite: 387]
    * [cite_start]$\frac{B}{A}$ is the Linear Rate constant. [cite: 382]
    * This is the reaction-controlled regime.
* [cite_start]**Case II: When t is very large [cite: 383]**
    * The linear term is negligible, and the growth is parabolic with time.
    * [cite_start]$X_{ox} \approx \sqrt{B t}$ [cite: 390]
    * [cite_start]$B$ is the Parabolic Rate constant. [cite: 392]
    * This is the diffusion-controlled regime. [cite_start]The growth rate slows down as the oxide thickens. [cite: 393]
* [cite_start]A diagram shows the oxide thickness ($X_{ox}$) versus time (t) curve, illustrating the initial linear region and the subsequent parabolic region. [cite: 398]

**Page 21: Oxidation Rate Constants and Temperature Dependence**
* This page shows two plots of the rate constants (linear B/A and parabolic B) versus inverse temperature ($1000/T(K^{-1})$), a common way to represent Arrhenius-type behavior.
* [cite_start]**Linear rate constant B/A (Âµm/h) [cite: 403]**:
    * [cite_start]The plot shows that B/A is higher for wet oxidation than dry oxidation. [cite: 417, 426]
    * [cite_start]It also shows that B/A is higher for (111) Si than (100) Si. [cite: 409]
    * [cite_start]The ratio $\frac{B/A(111)}{B/A(100)}$ is approximately 1.68. [cite: 411]
    * [cite_start]The activation energy for wet oxidation is $E_A = 2.05 eV$ and for dry oxidation is $E_A = 2.0 eV$. [cite: 418, 423]
* [cite_start]**Parabolic rate constant B (ÂµmÂ²/h) [cite: 429]**:
    * [cite_start]The plot shows that B is also higher for wet oxidation than dry oxidation. [cite: 434, 445]
    * [cite_start]The activation energy for wet oxidation is $E_A = 0.78 eV$ and for dry oxidation is $E_A = 1.23 eV$. [cite: 444, 446]
* [cite_start]**Values of both rate constant growth rate are higher for wet oxidation. [cite: 439, 440, 448]**
* [cite_start]**With increase in temperature rate constant values increases. [cite: 449]**
* [cite_start]**At higher temp, growth rate of oxide is higher [cite: 450, 451, 452]**.

**Page 22: Orientation-Dependence Effects**
* [cite_start]**Orientation-Dependence Effects [cite: 453]**
* [cite_start]**The parabolic growth rate has been found to be independent of crystal orientation... This is reasonable, since this parameter is a measure of the diffusivity of the oxidizing species through an amorphous silica layer. [cite: 454, 455]**. The amorphous nature of the oxide means it has no preferred orientation for diffusion.
* **The linear reaction rate, on the other hand, is related to the rate of incorporation of silicon atoms into the silica network. [cite_start]This, in turn, is a function of the atom concentration on the silicon surface, and is thus orientation-dependent. [cite: 456, 457]**.
* [cite_start]**The areal density of silicon atoms on the (111) plane is larger than that on the (100) plane, so we can expect the linear rate constant on (III) silicon to be somewhat larger than that for (100) silicon. [cite: 458]**. This explains why the linear rate constant is higher for (111) wafers.
* [cite_start]The text notes that the measured ratio of 1.68 is larger than what simple atom density considerations (1.16:1) would suggest, and explains this is due to more complex 3D atomic structure and size effects. [cite: 460, 461]

**Page 23: Doping Dependence Effects**
* [cite_start]**Doping Dependence Effects [cite: 462]**
* [cite_start]**Heavily doped silicon oxidizes at a faster rate than lightly doped material. [cite: 463]**. This is a general effect.
* [cite_start]**Boron-doped material [cite: 464]**:
    * [cite_start]Boron has a small segregation coefficient ($m<1$), meaning it prefers to stay in the silicon. [cite: 465, 466]
    * [cite_start]However, boron is incorporated into the oxide, which weakens the bonds and increases the diffusivity of the oxidizing species. [cite: 467]
    * [cite_start]This leads to an increase in the parabolic rate constant (B), but little change in the linear rate constant (B/A). [cite: 468]
* [cite_start]**Phosphorus-doped material [cite: 464]**:
    * [cite_start]Phosphorus has a large segregation coefficient ($m \approx 10$), meaning it prefers to stay in the silicon. [cite: 469]
    * [cite_start]It is only slightly incorporated into the oxide and tends to pile up at the Si-$SiO_2$ interface. [cite: 469]
    * [cite_start]This pile-up increases the reaction rate, leading to an increase in the linear rate constant (B/A). [cite: 470, 471]
    * [cite_start]The lack of phosphorus in the oxide means the parabolic rate constant (B) is relatively insensitive to doping. [cite: 472]
* [cite_start]The text refers to Figure 7.6 (on the next page) which illustrates these effects. [cite: 473]

**Page 24: Doping Dependence Effects Graph**
* This page shows the plot of rate constants B/A and B versus substrate phosphorus doping level ($N_D$).
* The plot confirms the discussion on the previous page:
    * The **linear rate constant (B/A)** increases significantly for high phosphorus doping concentrations.
    * The **parabolic rate constant (B)** shows a much smaller increase, remaining relatively insensitive to the doping level.

**Page 25: Practice Problem Question 1**
* This is the start of a practice problem. The question asks to calculate the growth rate of $SiO_2$ for a specific condition and to plot the variation of the growth rate. [cite_start]It also asks to explain the "Deal-triangle." [cite: 486, 487, 488, 489]
* [cite_start]The plot from page 21 is provided again for reference. [cite: 490, 491, 492, 493, 494, 495, 496, 497, 498, 499, 500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 505, 506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 513, 514, 515, 516, 517, 518, 519, 520, 521, 522, 523, 524, 525, 526]

**Page 26: Practice Problem Solution (Part i)**
* This page provides the solution for the first part of the problem.
* [cite_start]The Deal-Grove model equation is written: $x^2 + Ax = B(t + \tau)$[cite: 536].
* [cite_start]The growth rate is obtained by differentiating with respect to time: $\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{B}{A + 2x}$[cite: 538].
* From Figure 1 (the plot on page 25), the values of B and B/A for dry oxidation on (111) Si at $1000^{\circ}C$ are found.
    * At $1000^{\circ}C$, the inverse temperature is $1000/1273 \approx 0.785 K^{-1}$.
    * [cite_start]From the graph, B is read as $~0.01 \mu m^2/hr$. [cite: 543]
    * [cite_start]B/A is read as $~0.1 \mu m/hr$. [cite: 544]
* [cite_start]From these values, A is calculated: $A = \frac{B}{B/A} = \frac{0.01}{0.1} = 0.1 \mu m$. [cite: 546]
* The growth rate is then calculated for an oxide thickness of $x = 10 nm = 0.01 \mu m$:
    * [cite_start]$\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{0.01}{0.1 + 2 \times 0.01} = 0.0833 \mu m/hr \approx 83.3 nm/hr$. [cite: 549]
* The note indicates that this value is quite high for dry oxygen.

**Page 27: Practice Problem Solution (Part ii)**
* This page provides the solution for the second part of the problem, plotting the growth rate.
* [cite_start]The growth rate function is $\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{B}{A + 2x}$[cite: 538].
* [cite_start]The plot is of growth rate vs. oxide thickness ($t_{ox}$), which is a reciprocal-like function. [cite: 556]
* The values at different thicknesses are calculated using the derived values of A and B.
    * [cite_start]At $x=0$, $\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{B}{A} = 0.1 \mu m/hr = 100 nm/hr$. [cite: 553]
    * [cite_start]At $x=10 nm (0.01 \mu m)$, $\frac{dx}{dt} = 83 nm/hr$, as calculated on the previous page. [cite: 567]
    * [cite_start]At $x=25 nm (0.025 \mu m)$, $\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{0.01}{0.1 + 2 \times 0.025} = 0.0667 \mu m/hr \approx 66 nm/hr$. [cite: 569]
* The plot shows a decreasing, non-linear relationship between growth rate and oxide thickness, starting from a high value for thin oxides and decreasing as the oxide gets thicker.

**Page 28: Practice Problem Question 2**
* This is the start of another practice problem.
* **A silicon sphere having a diameter of $1 \mu m$ is completely oxidized by wet thermal oxidation process. [cite_start]Estimate the diameter of the newly formed $SiO_2$ sphere. [cite: 570, 571]**
* This problem tests the understanding of the volume expansion effect.

**Page 29: Practice Problem Solution (Part ii)**
* This page provides the solution to the problem.
* [cite_start]The key principle is that the volume of the silicon consumed is related to the volume of the $SiO_2$ formed by the volume expansion factor of 2.17. [cite: 578]
* Initial volume of Si sphere: $V_{Si} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r_{Si}^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (\frac{d_{Si}}{2})^3$
* Final volume of $SiO_2$ sphere: $V_{SiO_2} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r_{SiO_2}^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (\frac{d_{SiO_2}}{2})^3$
* The problem states the Si sphere is "completely oxidized," so the final volume of the $SiO_2$ sphere is equal to the volume of the consumed Si multiplied by the volume expansion factor.
* $V_{SiO_2} = 2.17 \times V_{Si}$
* [cite_start]$\frac{4}{3} \pi (\frac{d_{SiO_2}}{2})^3 = 2.17 \times \frac{4}{3} \pi (\frac{d_{Si}}{2})^3$ [cite: 588]
* The diameter of the Si sphere is given as $1 \mu m$, so $d_{Si} = 1 \mu m$.
* $(\frac{d_{SiO_2}}{2})^3 = 2.17 \times (\frac{1}{2})^3$
* $d_{SiO_2}^3 = 2.17 \times 1^3 \implies d_{SiO_2} = \sqrt[3]{2.17}$
* [cite_start]$d_{SiO_2} \approx 1.294 \mu m$. [cite: 590, 591, 592, 593]
* The solution shows the correct steps to arrive at the diameter of the new $SiO_2$ sphere.

**Page 30: Shortcoming of Deal-Grove Model**
* [cite_start]**Shortcoming of Deal-Grove Model [cite: 594]**
* [cite_start]**One weakness of the Deal-Grove model is the impossibility to predict the initial stage of the oxide growth [cite: 595]**.
* [cite_start]**Even with the best fit, approximately the first 30 nm of the oxide thickness can not be forecasted with the linear parabolic model [cite: 596]**.
* [cite_start]**Practically the oxide growth rate is fast and non-linear initially but the model offers only a linear fit for such thin thicknesses [cite: 597]**.
* The diagram shows the deviation. The actual oxide thickness (red curve) grows much faster initially than the linear extrapolation of the Deal-Grove model (blue line). The parameter $\tau$ in the model is used to account for this initial rapid growth by effectively shifting the time axis, but it doesn't accurately model the physical process.

**Page 31: High Pressure Oxidation**
* [cite_start]**High Pressure Oxidation System [cite: 605]**
* To grow very thick oxide layers, a long oxidation time or high temperature is required. [cite_start]This can damage the wafer or cause issues like devitrification in wet oxidation. [cite: 606, 607, 608]
* [cite_start]**Solution: Wet high pressure oxidation [cite: 609]**.
* [cite_start]The rate constants B/A and B are proportional to the partial pressure of the oxidant ($C^*$ term). [cite: 610]
* By increasing the pressure, the oxidation rate can be significantly increased.
* [cite_start]**Advantages: [cite: 611]**
    * [cite_start]Reduced time of oxidation [cite: 611]
    * [cite_start]Reduced thermal budget [cite: 611]
    * [cite_start]Thicker oxide can be grown at low temperature and less time. [cite: 613]
* [cite_start]The diagram shows a high-pressure oxidation chamber with a pressure-sealed reaction chamber, a pressure sensor, and valves to control the gas supply. [cite: 612, 614, 615, 616, 617, 618, 619, 620, 621]

**Page 32: Dopant Redistribution**
* [cite_start]**Dopant Redistribution at the interface [cite: 622]**
* [cite_start]**When Si gets oxidized, an interface is formed separating Si and $SiO_2$ [cite: 623]**.
* [cite_start]**Interface moves inside Si with oxide growth [cite: 624]**.
* [cite_start]**This causes dopants initially present in Si to get redistributed at the interface [cite: 625]**.
* [cite_start]**This causes an abrupt change in dopant concentration at the interface [cite: 626]**.
* [cite_start]**This is called Dopant Redistribution Effect [cite: 627]**.
* [cite_start]**Segregation Coefficient, m = $\frac{\text{Equilibrium dopant conc. in Si}}{\text{Equilibrium dopant conc. in } SiO_2}$ [cite: 628, 629]**.
* [cite_start]**Value of m can be greater or less than 1... [cite: 630]**. If $m < 1$, dopants prefer to go into the oxide. If $m > 1$, dopants prefer to stay in the silicon.
* [cite_start]Another factor is how fast the dopant diffuses through the $SiO_2$ layer. [cite: 631]
* [cite_start]This also explains why $SiO_2$ is used as a masking layer against dopants, as most common dopants diffuse slowly through $SiO_2$. [cite: 632, 633, 634]

**Page 33: Dopant Redistribution (Case m < 1)**
* This page illustrates two cases of dopant redistribution for a segregation coefficient $m < 1$.
* [cite_start]**Figure (a): Slow diffusion with m < 1 (e.g., Boron) [cite: 649, 660, 661, 662, 663]**
    * [cite_start]Boron prefers to move into the $SiO_2$ layer ($m < 1$) but diffuses slowly through it. [cite: 663, 664]
    * [cite_start]This leads to a depletion of Boron at the silicon side of the interface and a high concentration of Boron in the $SiO_2$ layer at the interface. [cite: 666]
* [cite_start]**Figure (b): Fast diffusion with m < 1 (e.g., Boron in hydrogen ambient) [cite: 653, 667, 668, 669]**
    * [cite_start]In a hydrogen ambient, Boron diffuses much faster through the $SiO_2$ layer. [cite: 669]
    * [cite_start]The concentration of boron drops sharply at the interface because it can easily move away from the interface and into the oxide. [cite: 671]

**Page 34: Dopant Redistribution (Case m > 1)**
* This page illustrates two cases of dopant redistribution for a segregation coefficient $m > 1$.
* [cite_start]**Figure (c): Slow diffusion with m > 1 (e.g., Phosphorous) [cite: 676, 688, 689, 690]**
    * [cite_start]Phosphorus prefers to stay in the silicon ($m > 1$). [cite: 692]
    * It is a slow diffuser through $SiO_2$.
    * This results in a "pile-up" of Phosphorus at the Si-$SiO_2$ interface. [cite_start]The concentration on the silicon side of the interface is higher than the bulk concentration. [cite: 694, 696, 697]
* [cite_start]**Figure (d): Fast diffusion with m > 1 (e.g., Gallium) [cite: 683, 702, 703]**
    * [cite_start]Gallium is an extremely fast diffuser through $SiO_2$. [cite: 703]
    * Even though it prefers to stay in silicon ($m > 1$), its high diffusivity prevents a pile-up at the interface. [cite_start]The concentration profile is smoother. [cite: 704, 705]

**Page 35: Non-idealities in Oxide**
* [cite_start]**Non-idealities inside the oxide [cite: 706]**
* This page introduces the concept of charges within the oxide layer that cause non-ideal behavior.
* [cite_start]**Ideally, the oxide should be an insulator: There should be no charge in the oxide [cite: 707]**.
* [cite_start]**The diagram illustrates four types of charges [cite: 711, 712, 718, 719]**:
    * [cite_start]**Mobile Ionic Charge ($Q_m$) [cite: 711]**: Due to mobile ions like $Na^+$, $K^+$.
    * [cite_start]**Oxide Trapped Charge ($Q_{ot}$) [cite: 712]**: Trapped electrons or holes in the bulk of the oxide.
    * [cite_start]**Fixed Oxide Charge ($Q_f$) [cite: 719]**: A fixed positive charge near the interface, related to excess Si ions.
    * [cite_start]**Interface Trapped Charge ($Q_{it}$) [cite: 718]**: Charges due to dangling bonds at the Si-$SiO_2$ interface.

**Page 36: Interface Trapped Charges and Fixed Oxide Charges**
* [cite_start]**Interface Trapped Charges ($Q_{it}$) [cite: 725]**
    * [cite_start]These are energy levels in the forbidden gap of silicon. [cite: 726]
    * [cite_start]They result from incomplete oxidation ($SiO_x$), structural defects, metallic impurities, and dangling bonds. [cite: 727, 728, 729, 730, 731]
    * [cite_start]They can be positive, negative, or neutral. [cite: 732]
    * [cite_start]Density: $10^9$ to $10^{11}/cm^2 eV$. [cite: 733]
    * [cite_start]Can be reduced by post-oxidation annealing in hydrogen at $400^{\circ}C$. [cite: 734]
* [cite_start]**Fixed Oxide Charges ($Q_f$) [cite: 735]**

    * [cite_start]Does not change under normal conditions. [cite: 739]

**Page 38: Deal Triangle**
* [cite_start]**Deal Triangle [cite: 755]**
* This diagram and explanation show how the fixed oxide charge density ($Q_f/q$) changes with temperature and ambient.
* [cite_start]**At the end of oxidation, the temperature is lowered. [cite: 756]**
* [cite_start]If cooling is done in an oxygen ambient ($Dry O_2$), oxidation continues at a lower rate, resulting in incomplete oxidation and an increase in $Q_f$. [cite: 757, 758, 759]
* [cite_start]If cooling is done in an inert ambient ($Ar/N_2$), oxidation stops completely, and the value of $Q_f$ can be reduced. [cite: 760, 761, 762, 763, 764, 765, 766]
* The Deal Triangle graph plots fixed oxide charge vs. temperature, showing a linear decrease with increasing temperature in a dry $O_2$ ambient. The vertical lines represent cooling in an inert ambient, which preserves the low charge state achieved at high temperatures.

**Page 39: Rapid Thermal Oxidation (RTO)**
* [cite_start]**Rapid Thermal Oxidation [cite: 767]**
* [cite_start]**The decreasing size of semiconductor devices demands very short high-temperature oxidation steps... [cite: 768]**. This is because long, high-temperature processes can cause unwanted diffusion of impurities, affecting device performance.
* [cite_start]**This can be achieved by precisely controlling the oxidation temperature and reducing the thermal budget of the heat cycle... [cite: 770]**.
* [cite_start]**Conventional furnaces have high thermal inertia, making it difficult to achieve a low thermal budget. [cite: 771]**.
* [cite_start]**The thermal budget can be reduced considerably by decreasing the duration of these transitions. [cite: 772]**.
* [cite_start]**Rapid thermal processing (RTP) is the solution. [cite: 773]**.
* [cite_start]The top diagram compares a conventional process with a "Rapid process" (RTP), showing the much faster heating and cooling ramps of the RTP. [cite: 774, 775, 776, 777, 778, 779, 780, 781]
* [cite_start]The bottom diagram shows a schematic of an RTP system. [cite: 782, 783, 784, 785, 786, 787, 788, 789, 790]

**Page 40: Rapid Thermal Oxidation (Cont.)**
* [cite_start]**During RTP, the wafer is rapidly heated from a low to a high processing temperature... and then brought back rapidly to a low temperature. [cite: 792, 793]**.
* [cite_start]Typical ramp rates for RTP are 10 to 350 Â°C/s, much faster than furnace processing (0.1 Â°C/s). [cite: 794]
* [cite_start]Processing times at high temperature are short (1s to 5min). [cite: 795]
* [cite_start]This makes RTP suitable for growing very thin oxide films (<40 nm). [cite: 796]
* [cite_start]RTP systems use an array of lamps as a heat source and are typically single-wafer machines, unlike batch furnaces. [cite: 797, 798, 799]
* A major challenge in RTP is accurately measuring the wafer temperature, which changes very quickly. [cite_start]This is often done using an infrared pyrometer from the back side of the wafer. [cite: 800, 801, 802, 803, 804]

**Page 41: Measurements**
* This page is a placeholder, leading into the methods for measuring oxide properties.

**Page 42: Measuring Oxide Thickness by Color**
* This page shows a color chart that relates the apparent color of an $SiO_2$ film on a silicon wafer to its thickness.
* [cite_start]**The appearance of color is due to the constructive and destructive interference of light. [cite: 842]**.
* [cite_start]The table and the visual chart provide a quick, non-destructive way to estimate oxide thickness. [cite: 813, 814, 815, 816, 817, 818, 819, 820, 821, 822, 823, 824, 825, 826, 827, 828, 829, 830]
* [cite_start]An equation for the wavelengths undergoing destructive interference is given: $\lambda_k = \frac{5.84 t}{2k+1}$[cite: 844]. Here, $t$ is the oxide thickness, and $k$ is an integer.

* [cite_start]The formula for a parallel plate capacitor is used: $C_{max} = \frac{\epsilon_{ox} A}{t_{ox}}$. [cite: 950]
* [cite_start]This can be rearranged to find the oxide thickness: $t_{ox} = \frac{\epsilon_{ox} A}{C_{max}}$. [cite: 950]

**Page 45: Estimating Fixed Oxide Charge Density ($Q_f$)**
* This page explains how to estimate the fixed oxide charge density by observing the shift in the flat-band voltage ($V_{FB}$) of a MOS capacitor's C-V curve.
* [cite_start]The C-V curve for an ideal and a practical (non-ideal) MOS capacitor is shown. [cite: 962, 963]
* [cite_start]The presence of the fixed oxide charge ($Q_f$) shifts the C-V curve to the left (more negative $V_G$), causing a shift in the flat-band voltage. [cite: 954, 961]
* [cite_start]The formula relating $V_{FB}$ to $Q_f$ is: $V_{FB} = \Phi_{ms} - Q_f/C_{ox}$. [cite: 974]
* [cite_start]By measuring the practical $V_{FB}$ and knowing the work function difference $\Phi_{ms}$ and the oxide capacitance $C_{ox}$, the value of $Q_f$ can be extracted. [cite: 974, 976, 977, 978, 979]

**Page 46: Estimating Interface Trap Density ($D_{it}$)**
* [cite_start]**Estimating Interface Trap Density [cite: 982]**
* [cite_start]Interface trap density ($D_{it}$) is measured by comparing the low-frequency and high-frequency C-V curves of a MOS capacitor. [cite: 993, 997]
* Interface traps can respond to a low-frequency AC signal, but not a high-frequency one.
* [cite_start]Therefore, the low-frequency C-V curve shows a change in slope, while the high-frequency curve remains flat in the depletion region. [cite: 983, 984, 991, 994]
* [cite_start]The difference between these two curves is used to calculate the interface trap density, which is given by the formula: $D_{it} = \frac{1}{q} (\frac{C_{LF}}{C_i - C_{LF}} - \frac{C_i C_{HF}}{C_i - C_{HF}}) cm^{-2}eV^{-1}$. [cite: 1008]

**Page 47: Mobile Charge Measurement**
* [cite_start]**Mobile Charge [cite: 1009]**
* This page explains how the presence of mobile ionic charges ($Q_m$) can be detected by stressing the MOS capacitor with a high bias at elevated temperatures (Bias-Temperature Stress).
* [cite_start]The C-V curve shifts depending on the bias applied. [cite: 1010, 1011, 1012, 1013, 1014]
* For example, applying a positive bias at high temperature shifts the mobile charges to the Si-$SiO_2$ interface, causing a shift in the C-V curve. [cite_start]Applying a negative bias shifts them to the metal-oxide interface. [cite: 1018, 1019, 1020, 1028]
* This behavior, the "odd shifts," was once a mystery but is now understood to be caused by mobile charges changing their location.

### Diffusion Lecture Notes

Now, I will proceed with the lecture notes on Diffusion, slide by slide.

**Page 1: Title Slide**
* [cite_start]**VLSI Process Technology 2025 [cite: 1090]**
* [cite_start]**Diffusion [cite: 1091]**

This is the title page for the diffusion part of the course.

**Page 2: Introduction to Diffusion**
* [cite_start]**Diffusion [cite: 1099]**:
    * [cite_start]**Process of introducing controlled amount of impurities in an already grown semiconductor crystal... [cite: 1100]**. This is the fundamental definition. Diffusion is a method for doping a semiconductor.
    * [cite_start]**...for the purpose of altering its electronic properties [cite: 1100]**. Doping is done to change the conductivity of the material, making it n-type or p-type.
    * [cite_start]**During diffusion, the semiconductor is subjected to a high temperature ambient containing the diffusing impurities (or Diffusant) [cite: 1101]**. This describes the process conditions: high temperature and a source of dopant atoms.
    * [cite_start]**Dopants move inside the crystal because of concentration gradient [cite: 1102]**. This is the driving force for diffusion. Atoms move from a region of high concentration (the surface) to low concentration (the bulk).
    * [cite_start]**Dopants move through point defects, vacancies, interstitial spaces etc. [cite: 1103]**. This describes the microscopic mechanism of movement within the crystal lattice.
    * [cite_start]**Can be viewed as atomic movement of the dopant atoms inside the lattice [cite: 1104]**.
    * [cite_start]**Usually adopted for batch process [cite: 1105]**. Many wafers can be processed at once.
    * [cite_start]**Does not create crystal damage... [cite: 1106]**. Unlike ion implantation, which is a non-equilibrium process and causes lattice damage, diffusion is an equilibrium process performed at high temperature, which anneals out defects as they are created.

**Page 3: Substitutional Diffusion**
* [cite_start]**Classification [cite: 1107]**
* [cite_start]**Substitutional: [cite: 1108]**
    * [cite_start]**Dopant atoms wander through the crystal by jumping from one lattice site to the next: substituting for the original host atom [cite: 1112]**. This is the mechanism where the dopant atom occupies a site normally held by a silicon atom.
    * [cite_start]**For substitutional diffusion, the adjacent site must necessarily be vacant [cite: 1113]**. This is a key requirement for this mechanism. The atom jumps into an adjacent vacancy.
    * [cite_start]**The atoms need to break their bond... and cause necessary lattice distortion during the jump [cite: 1114]**. This requires a significant amount of energy, which is why substitutional diffusion is a slow process.
    * [cite_start]**Atoms flow in the direction opposite to the vacancies [cite: 1115]**.
    * [cite_start]**Equilibrium concentration of vacancy is less: Substitutional diffusion occur at much lower rate [cite: 1116]**.
    * [cite_start]**Example: diffusion of P, B etc. [cite: 1116]**. These are common substitutional dopants in silicon.
* The diagram illustrates the process. [cite_start]A dopant atom (black circle) moves into a vacant site, and the vacancy moves in the opposite direction. [cite: 1117, 1118, 1119]

**Page 4: Interstitial Diffusion**
* [cite_start]**Interstitial: [cite: 1120]**
    * [cite_start]**Dopant atoms move through the crystal through the interstitial space: jumping from one interstitial site to another. [cite: 1122]**. In this mechanism, the dopant atom does not replace a host atom.
    * [cite_start]**Relatively fast due to large amount of interstitial space available... [cite: 1123]**. No vacancies are needed, and no bonds need to be broken, making it a much faster process.
    * **Example: Gr. I and Gr. [cite_start]VIII elements like, Cu, Li, He, Ar etc. [cite: 1124]**. The notes mention an exception for Li.
* [cite_start]**Modification of the interstitial diffusion process: Interstitial substitutional diffusion [cite: 1126]**.
    * This is a hybrid mechanism where the dopant can occupy both interstitial and substitutional sites.
    * [cite_start]The overall diffusion is classified as interstitial because the movement is governed by the fast interstitial component. [cite: 1128]
    * [cite_start]The notes contrast the speeds of interstitial vs. substitutional diffusion. [cite: 1129, 1130]

**Page 5: Interstitial-Substitutional Mechanisms**
* This page shows two specific mechanisms for interstitial-substitutional diffusion.
* [cite_start]**Dissociative Mechanism [cite: 1135]**:
    * [cite_start]A substitutional impurity atom (black circle) moves out to an interstitial site, leaving a vacancy behind. [cite: 1136]
    * [cite_start]The diagram shows this movement. [cite: 1131, 1132]
* [cite_start]**Kick-out Mechanism [cite: 1137]**:
    * [cite_start]A rapidly moving interstitial dopant atom "kicks out" a host silicon atom from its lattice site, taking its place. [cite: 1138]
    * This creates a "self-interstitial" (a silicon atom in an interstitial site).
    * [cite_start]The diagram shows this process. [cite: 1133, 1134]

**Page 6: Interstitialcy Diffusion**
* [cite_start]**Interstitialcy: [cite: 1139]**
    * [cite_start]**Modified version of substitutional diffusion [cite: 1140]**.
    * [cite_start]**A diffusion mechanism where an interstitial impurity occupies the position of a substitutional host atom by pushing it to an interstitial site [cite: 1142]**.
    * The diagram illustrates this. A dopant atom pushes a host atom into an interstitial position. [cite_start]The dopant atom then takes the host's previous substitutional site. [cite: 1146, 1147, 1148, 1149]
    * [cite_start]**The interstitial position of a diffusing impurity is purely a transition state [cite: 1144]**.
    * [cite_start]**Interstitialcy diffusion is faster than substitutional diffusion [cite: 1145]**.

**Page 7: Diffusion Mechanism and Key Parameters**
* [cite_start]**Diffusion mechanism of an impurity depends on: [cite: 1151]**
    * [cite_start]Type of impurity (substitutional or interstitial) [cite: 1152]
    * [cite_start]Size of the diffusant and host site [cite: 1153]
    * [cite_start]Temperature [cite: 1154]
    * [cite_start]Presence of other impurities [cite: 1155]
    * [cite_start]Electronic structure of the host [cite: 1156]
* [cite_start]**From diffusion mechanism, we get to know about: [cite: 1157]**
    * [cite_start]Junction depth [cite: 1158]
    * [cite_start]Doping profile [cite: 1159]
    * [cite_start]Surface concentration of dopant [cite: 1160]

**Page 8: Fick's First Law of Diffusion**
* [cite_start]**Fick's Law of Diffusion [cite: 1166]**
* [cite_start]**One-dimensional analysis of diffusion is done by Fick's law [cite: 1167]**.
* [cite_start]**Fick's law is given by: $j = -D \frac{\partial N}{\partial x}$ [cite: 1168]**.
    * [cite_start]$j$ is the flux (rate of transfer of dopant per unit area). [cite: 1170]
    * [cite_start]$N$ is the concentration of the dopant. [cite: 1172]
    * [cite_start]$x$ is the direction of movement. [cite: 1173]
    * $\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}$ is the concentration gradient. [cite_start]The negative sign indicates movement from high to low concentration. [cite: 1174, 1175]
    * [cite_start]$D$ is the diffusion coefficient. [cite: 1176]
* [cite_start]This law is valid for steady-state diffusion where the system does not change with time. [cite: 1169]
* [cite_start]It is also valid for dilute solutions, where the dopant concentration is much less than the host atom concentration. [cite: 1171]
* [cite_start]The diagram shows two planes (P1 and P2) and the flux of dopants moving from P1 to P2. [cite: 1161, 1162, 1163, 1164, 1165]

**Page 9: Diffusion Coefficient**
* [cite_start]**Diffusion coefficient is represented as, $D = D_0 \exp(-\frac{E_A}{kT})$ [cite: 1177, 1180]**. This is the Arrhenius equation.
    * [cite_start]$D_0$ is a pre-exponential factor, independent of temperature. [cite: 1178]
    * [cite_start]$E_A$ is the activation energy of diffusion. [cite: 1179]
* [cite_start]**Activation energy determines how difficult or easy it is for the diffusant to move inside the semiconductor [cite: 1181]**.
* [cite_start]**Value of activation energy of Substitutional diffusion (3-4 eV) is higher than that of Interstitial diffusion (0.6-1.2 eV) [cite: 1182]**. This is why substitutional diffusion is slower.
* [cite_start]**Value of diffusion coefficient or diffusivity increases with increase in temperature [cite: 1184]**.

**Page 10: Diffusion Coefficient Properties**
* This page lists the factors that the diffusion coefficient depends on or is independent of.
* [cite_start]**Diffusion coefficient is: [cite: 1185]**
    * [cite_start]Independent of concentration gradient [cite: 1186]
    * [cite_start]A material property [cite: 1187]
    * [cite_start]Function of composition of material and temperature [cite: 1188]
    * [cite_start]Dependent on crystal structure (D of BCC is higher than FCC) [cite: 1189]
    * [cite_start]Dependent on crystal imperfections, concentration of diffusing species etc. [cite: 1190]

**Page 11: Fick's Second Law of Diffusion**
* [cite_start]**Fick's Second Law [cite: 1196]**
* This law deals with the change in dopant concentration over time due to accumulation.
* [cite_start]**As the dopants move from P1 to P2, some dopants might remain in the space in between the two planes... [cite: 1197]**.
* [cite_start]**...there is some accumulation of the dopant species in between the two planes [cite: 1198]**.
* [cite_start]**If dopant atoms are accumulating, then there will be a change in the concentration [cite: 1200]**.
* Fick's second law is derived by considering the net flux into a small volume. [cite_start]The rate of change of concentration with time is related to the second derivative of concentration with respect to distance. [cite: 1201, 1202, 1203]
* [cite_start]The final equation is: $\frac{\partial N}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 N}{\partial x^2}$[cite: 1203].
* [cite_start]This is called Fick's simple law of diffusion, assuming D is constant. [cite: 1204]

**Page 12: Infinite Source Diffusion (Pre-deposition)**
* [cite_start]**Situation when D is constant [cite: 1205]**
* [cite_start]**Infinite source diffusion or Constant source diffusion (Pre-deposition) [cite: 1206]**
    * This is the first step in a two-step diffusion process.
    * [cite_start]**Diffusion is carried out with the source on: Surface concentration of dopants is always constant [cite: 1207]**.
    * [cite_start]The surface concentration, $N_0$, is limited by the solid solubility of the dopant in silicon. [cite: 1208]
* [cite_start]**Boundary Conditions: [cite: 1210]**
    * $N(0, t) = N_0$ (constant surface concentration)
    * $N(\infty, t) = 0$ (zero concentration far from the surface)
* [cite_start]**Initial Condition: [cite: 1211, 1212]**
    * $N(x, 0) = 0$ (no dopants initially present)
* [cite_start]**The solution to Fick's second law under these conditions is: $N(x, t) = N_0 erfc(\frac{x}{2\sqrt{Dt}})$ [cite: 1214]**.
* [cite_start]$erfc(x)$ is the complementary error function, defined as $1 - erf(x)$. [cite: 1215, 1216]
* The graph shows the doping profile at different times ($t_1 < t_2 < t_3 < t_4$). [cite_start]The surface concentration remains constant at $N_0$, and the junction depth increases over time. [cite: 1217, 1218, 1219, 1220, 1221, 1222, 1223, 1224, 1225]

**Page 13: Infinite Source Diffusion (Cont.)**
* [cite_start]**Total Dose ($Q$) = Area under the curve... $Q = 2N_0 \sqrt{\frac{Dt}{\pi}}$ [cite: 1226]**. This is the total number of dopant atoms per unit area incorporated into the silicon.
* [cite_start]**Finding junction depth from doping profile: [cite: 1227]**
    * [cite_start]**Junction depth ($x_j$) is the point where the dopant concentration equals the background substrate doping concentration ($N_C$). [cite: 1229]**.
    * [cite_start]The junction depth is found by setting $N(x_j, t) = N_C$: $N_C = N_0 erfc(\frac{x_j}{2\sqrt{Dt}})$[cite: 1231].
* [cite_start]**In order to have a deep junction, [cite: 1232]**
    * [cite_start]**Either diffusion has to be carried out for longer time (increasing t) [cite: 1233]**.
    * [cite_start]**Value of D has to be increased increasing temperature (T) [cite: 1234]**.

**Page 14: Constant Total Impurity (Drive-in)**
* [cite_start]**Constant total impurity (Drive-in) [cite: 1236]**
* This is the second step in a two-step diffusion process.
* [cite_start]**Pre-deposition is carried out first... which results in a thin sheet of dopant very close to the surface [cite: 1237, 1238, 1239]**.
* [cite_start]**In the next step, the source is shut off... and the sample... is subjected further to high temperature processing [cite: 1240]**.
* [cite_start]**The total amount of impurity is fixed... and gets further driven inside the semiconductor material [cite: 1243, 1244]**.
* [cite_start]**This step is also referred to as the drive-in step [cite: 1245]**.

**Page 15: Constant Total Impurity (Cont.)**
* [cite_start]**Boundary Conditions: [cite: 1246]**
    * $\int_0^{\infty} N dx = Q$ (Total dose is constant).
    * $N(\infty, t) = 0$
* [cite_start]**Doping profile obtained is: $N(x, t) = \frac{Q}{\sqrt{\pi Dt}} \exp(-\frac{x^2}{4Dt})$ [cite: 1248, 1250]**. This is a Gaussian distribution.
* [cite_start]**Surface Concentration: $N_S = N(0, t) = \frac{Q}{\sqrt{\pi Dt}}$ [cite: 1251, 1261]**. Unlike pre-deposition, the surface concentration is not constant and decreases over time as the dopants are driven in.
* The graph shows the Gaussian profile. [cite_start]As time increases ($t_1$ to $t_4$), the surface concentration decreases, and the junction depth increases. [cite: 1252, 1253, 1254, 1255, 1256, 1257, 1258, 1259, 1260]
* [cite_start]**Finding junction depth from doping profile: [cite: 1262]**
    * [cite_start]$N_C = \frac{Q}{\sqrt{\pi Dt}} \exp(-\frac{x_j^2}{4Dt})$[cite: 1264].
    * [cite_start]$x_j = 2\sqrt{Dt} \ln(\frac{N_S}{N_C})$[cite: 1266].

**Page 16: Diffusion Coefficient as a Function of Doping Concentration**
* [cite_start]**Situation when D is a function of Doping Concentration [cite: 1267]**
* In some cases, the diffusion coefficient (D) is not constant but depends on the doping concentration (N).
* [cite_start]**When D is a function of doping concentration, it is represented as: $D \propto N$ or $D=kN$ [cite: 1269, 1270]**.
* [cite_start]The slide shows that the relationship can also be quadratic ($D \propto N^2$) or cubic ($D \propto N^3$). [cite: 1283]
* [cite_start]The graph shows how the doping profile changes depending on the dependence of D on N. [cite: 1284, 1297, 1299, 1300, 1301, 1302, 1303, 1304, 1305, 1306]
* [cite_start]**As D shows higher dependence on N, the junction becomes shallower [cite: 1292]**. This is shown by the junction depth formulas for different dependencies. [cite_start]For example, $x_j$ for $D \propto N^3$ is smaller than for $D \propto N$. [cite: 1294, 1295, 1298]

**Page 17: Lateral Diffusion**
* [cite_start]**Lateral Diffusion: [cite: 1307]**
* This page addresses the fact that diffusion is not only vertical but also spreads horizontally under a mask.
* [cite_start]The diagram shows an ideal case where the dopants diffuse only vertically, creating a perfect rectangular profile. [cite: 1327]
* [cite_start]The practical case is shown with a curved profile, indicating that dopants have also diffused laterally under the mask. [cite: 1325]
* [cite_start]The ratio of lateral to vertical diffusion is typically 75-85% of the vertical junction depth. [cite: 1329]
* [cite_start]The diagram with concentration contours ($C_1 = N/N_{surface}$) visually confirms this lateral spread. [cite: 1308, 1309, 1310, 1311, 1312, 1313, 1314, 1315, 1316, 1317, 1318, 1319, 1320, 1321, 1322, 1323]
* [cite_start]**Deeper the junction, higher is the lateral diffusion [cite: 1331]**.

**Page 18: Diffusion Systems**
* [cite_start]**Diffusion is a high temperature process ($800-1200^{\circ}C$) and is carried out in a fused quartz tube... [cite: 1333]**.
* [cite_start]The silicon wafers are exposed to an ambient containing dopants, usually as an oxide. [cite: 1334, 1335]
* [cite_start]The source material can be solid, liquid, or gas. [cite: 1336]
    * [cite_start]**Solid source: Placed close to the silicon sample [cite: 1337]**.
    * [cite_start]**Liquid source: Gas is bubbled through it to pick up vapor [cite: 1338, 1339]**.
    * [cite_start]**Gaseous source: Passed directly into the furnace [cite: 1339]**.

**Page 19: Diffusion Systems Diagram**
* This page provides a sketch of a generalized diffusion system.
* It shows a quartz tube with a heater. [cite_start]Gas inlets for carrier gases ($O_2$, $N_2$) and a gas source are shown. [cite: 1340, 1341, 1346, 1348, 1349]
* [cite_start]A liquid source bubbler is shown, as well as a solid source (Boron Nitride disc) and gas source inlets. [cite: 1344, 1345, 1350, 1351]
* [cite_start]The silicon wafers are held vertically in a carrier inside the tube. [cite: 1343]

**Page 20: Boron in Silicon**
* This page discusses specific dopants, starting with Boron.
* [cite_start]**Boron in Silicon [cite: 1353]**
* [cite_start]It has a high misfit factor (0.254), meaning not all introduced Boron atoms are electronically active. [cite: 1355, 1356]
* [cite_start]The surface concentration can be as high as $4 \times 10^{20}/cm^3$, but the active concentration is only around $5 \times 10^{19}/cm^3$. [cite: 1354, 1356]
* The notes mention the problem of "boron skin" forming when using $B_2O_3$ directly. [cite_start]This layer is difficult to remove. [cite: 1359, 1360, 1361, 1362]
* [cite_start]**Preferred solid source: Boron nitride (BN) [cite: 1363]**.
* [cite_start]**Liquid sources: Trimethyl Borate (TMB) and Boron Tribromide ($BBr_3$) [cite: 1364]**.
* [cite_start]$BBr_3$ has the advantage of a gettering agent (Bromine), but the disadvantage of being hazardous and potentially causing "bromine pitting." [cite: 1366, 1367, 1368, 1369]

**Page 21: Phosphorus and Arsenic in Silicon**
* [cite_start]**Phosphorus in Silicon [cite: 1370]**
    * [cite_start]Diffusion coefficient is given. [cite: 1371]
    * [cite_start]Has a very low misfit factor, allowing for high impurity concentration (up to $1 \times 10^{21}/cm^3$). [cite: 1372, 1373]
    * [cite_start]Basic reaction: $2P_2O_5 + 5Si \rightarrow 4P + 5SiO_2$ [cite: 1374]
    * [cite_start]$P_2O_5$ is rarely used directly due to being hygroscopic. [cite: 1375]
    * [cite_start]**Common liquid source: $POCl_3$ [cite: 1376]**.
    * [cite_start]**Gaseous source: Phosphene (highly toxic) [cite: 1377]**.
* [cite_start]**Arsenic in Silicon [cite: 1378]**
    * [cite_start]Diffusion coefficient is given. [cite: 1379]
    * [cite_start]Has a misfit factor of 0, as its tetrahedral radius matches silicon exactly. [cite: 1380]
    * [cite_start]Basic reaction: $2As_2O_3 + 3Si \rightarrow 4As + 3SiO_2$ [cite: 1381]
    * [cite_start]**The ambient must be free of oxygen during arsenic diffusion. [cite: 1382]**. [cite_start]Even a thin oxide layer will block arsenic diffusion, so it's done in an $N_2$ ambient. [cite: 1383]
    * Arsenic is volatile, leading to an "out diffusion" problem. [cite_start]Spin-on technique is a viable alternative. [cite: 1384, 1385]

**Page 22: Successive Diffusion**
* This page illustrates the effect of performing two successive diffusion steps.
* The diagrams show a two-step doping process:
    1.  [cite_start]A p+ region is diffused into an n-type silicon substrate, creating a junction at a certain depth. [cite: 1387, 1388, 1389, 1391, 1403]
    2.  [cite_start]A second, highly doped n++ region ($N_{D2}$) is diffused into the p+ region. [cite: 1386, 1395]
* [cite_start]The final concentration profile is shown, where the second diffusion changes both the surface concentration and the junction depth of the first profile. [cite: 1396, 1397, 1398, 1399, 1400, 1401, 1404]

**Page 23: Diffusion vs. Ion-implantation**
* This page provides a table comparing the two primary doping methods in VLSI.
* [cite_start]**Diffusion [cite: 1411]**:
    * [cite_start]Prone to contamination. [cite: 1411]
    * [cite_start]Less control over doping profile (5-10%). [cite: 1413]
    * [cite_start]High-temperature process, requires $SiO_2$ as a mask. [cite: 1414]
    * [cite_start]Less flexible. [cite: 1415]
    * [cite_start]Equilibrium process. [cite: 1416]
    * [cite_start]Less expensive. [cite: 1417]
    * [cite_start]Less damage. [cite: 1418]
* [cite_start]**Ion-implantation [cite: 1419]**:
    * [cite_start]Less prone to contamination (high vacuum). [cite: 1420]
    * [cite_start]More control over doping profile ($\pm$1%). [cite: 1421]
    * [cite_start]Room-temperature process, can use photoresist (PR) as a mask. [cite: 1421]
    * [cite_start]More flexible (dose and energy can be controlled independently). [cite: 1422]
    * [cite_start]Non-equilibrium process. [cite: 1423]
    * [cite_start]Very expensive. [cite: 1424]
    * [cite_start]More damage, which requires a subsequent annealing step. [cite: 1425]
