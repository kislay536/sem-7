### Crystal Structures and VLSI Fabrication

**1. Difference between a Lattice and a Basis**
A crystal is formed by adding a basis to each point of a lattice. The lattice is a hypothetical, repeating arrangement of points in space that defines the periodicity of the crystal. The basis is the group of atoms, molecules, or single atoms associated with each lattice point. For example, in a sodium chloride (NaCl) crystal, the lattice is a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice, and the basis is a pair of one sodium ion and one chlorine ion.

**2. Silicon's Diamond Cubic Structure vs. BCC Crystal Structure**
Silicon's diamond cubic structure is a degenerate form of the zincblende structure. This structure can be visualized as two interpenetrating FCC sublattices. Unlike a BCC structure, which has a coordination number of 8, the diamond cubic structure has a coordination number of 4. This tetrahedral bonding arrangement in silicon is crucial to its semiconductor properties, as it results in a specific band gap that enables its use in electronic devices. A BCC structure, with its higher coordination number, would have a different electronic band structure, which would not be ideal for semiconductor applications.

**3. Why Simple Cubic Structure is Rarely Observed in Semiconductors**
Simple cubic (SC) structures are very rare in real materials, with Polonium being a notable exception. This is because the SC structure has a low atomic packing factor (0.52), meaning the atoms are not packed very densely. Most elements prefer crystal structures with higher packing densities, such as body-centered cubic (BCC) (0.68) or face-centered cubic (FCC) (0.74), as they are more energetically stable.

**4. Why (100) Orientation is Preferred in MOSFET Fabrication**
The (100) crystal orientation is preferred for MOSFET fabrication because it offers better control of the threshold voltage and has fewer interface traps. This leads to improved device performance, specifically higher electron mobility in the channel.

**5. Why {111} Planes are Most Closely Packed**
In a cubic crystal, the {111} planes have the smallest interplanar separation. This makes them the most closely spaced planes. The growth of a crystal along a (111) direction is the slowest because it involves depositing atomic layers in their closest-packed form. This makes (111) wafers the easiest and cheapest to grow.

**6. Role of Dangling Bonds in Etching**
Dangling bonds are unsatisfied valence bonds on the surface of a crystal. The density of dangling bonds varies with crystal orientation. The (100) planes have a higher density of dangling bonds than the (110) or (111) planes. Because crystal dissolution is directly related to the density of broken bonds, a higher density of dangling bonds makes a surface easier to etch. Therefore, etching is fastest in the (100) direction and slowest in the (111) direction. This property is used in techniques like creating V-grooves in (100)-oriented silicon wafers.

**7. Preferable Orientation for High Dopant Diffusion**
Dopant diffusion in a semiconductor is a process of atomic movement within the crystal lattice. While the provided documents don't specify which crystal orientation has the highest diffusion rate, they do state that diffusion is an orientation-dependent process.

**8. Adhesion of Thin Films**
The provided documents do not contain information about how crystal structure influences the adhesion of thin films during deposition. However, other sources indicate that the crystal structure of the substrate can influence the structure and properties of deposited films, which in turn can affect adhesion.

**9. Miller Indices Calculation**
For a cubic lattice, a plane with intercepts at 6 Å, 3 Å, and 2 Å is calculated as follows:
* **Intercepts:** The intercepts are 6, 3, and 2.
* **Reciprocals:** Take the reciprocals of the intercepts: $1/6$, $1/3$, $1/2$.
* **Clear Fractions:** To get the smallest whole numbers, find a common denominator (6) and multiply each reciprocal by it:
  * $(1/6) \times 6 = 1$
  * $(1/3) \times 6 = 2$
  * $(1/2) \times 6 = 3$
* **Miller Indices:** The Miller indices are (123).

**10. Interplanar Distance**
For a cubic crystal, the interplanar distance between adjacent parallel planes {hkl} is given by the formula:
$$d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2}}$$
Given a lattice constant ($a$) of 0.8 nm and planes with indices {210}, the interplanar distance is:
$$d = \frac{0.8~\text{nm}}{\sqrt{2^2+1^2+0^2}} = \frac{0.8~\text{nm}}{\sqrt{5}} \approx 0.358~\text{nm}$$
Therefore, the interplanar distance is not 0.4 nm.

**11. Why Diamond Lattice is Preferable for Silicon**
Even with a lower packing density (0.34) compared to FCC (0.74) and BCC (0.68), the diamond lattice structure is preferred for silicon because its tetrahedral bonding arrangement is what gives silicon its unique semiconductor properties. This specific bonding structure is critical for the electrical behavior required for electronic devices.

**12. (111) Wafers: Easy to Grow, Hard to Etch**
(111) silicon wafers are considered the easiest and cheapest to grow. This is because the (111) planes have the smallest interplanar separation, allowing for the closest packed arrangement of atoms, which makes crystal growth along this direction the slowest and most stable. However, this same close packing and low density of dangling bonds make them the most difficult to etch chemically.

**13. Angle between (100) and (111) Planes**
The angle between two planes ($u_1, v_1, w_1$) and ($u_2, v_2, w_2$) in a cubic crystal can be calculated using the formula:
$$\cos\theta = \frac{u_1u_2 + v_1v_2 + w_1w_2}{\sqrt{(u_1^2+v_1^2+w_1^2)(u_2^2+v_2^2+w_2^2)}}$$
For the (100) plane, $u_1=1, v_1=0, w_1=0$.
For the (111) plane, $u_2=1, v_2=1, w_2=1$.
$$\cos\theta = \frac{(1)(1) + (0)(1) + (0)(1)}{\sqrt{(1^2+0^2+0^2)(1^2+1^2+1^2)}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 \times 3}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$$
$$\theta = \arccos\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) \approx 54.74^\circ$$
